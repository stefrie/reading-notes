# Code 102 | Class 2

## Text Editors
There are a variety of types of text editors, but the you'll primarily want to find ones that have the following features:
* code completion
* highlighting
* themes (which are nice for personalization but also to reduce eye strain)
* extensions

I personally also enjoy having a text editor that also includes other features helpful for coding, such as the ability to house multiple tabs, as well as an inline terminal option.

## CLI (Command Line Interface)
* CLEAR - to clear the screen
* PWD - Print Working Directory (tells you where you are)
* LS - list of files within the directory that you’re in
* CD - Change Directory
* CD (folder name) - moves you to a folder within the current directory
* CD .. - moves you up one level
* CD ../../ - takes you up two levels
* CD ../(folder name) - takes you up one level, folder name takes you to 
* MKDIR - “make directory” 
* MKDIR (folder name) - to create a new folder within the current directory
* MKDIR (folder name)/(folder name) - to make a folder within a folder in your existing directory
* MKDIR (folder name) (folder name) - to create multiple folders within the same folder
* MKDIR (folder name)/(folder name) (folder name) - to make multiple folders in the sub directory
* TOUCH - creates a new file
* MKDIR (folder name) && TOUCH (file name.ext) - to make a folder, then a file within that folder
* TOUCH (folder name)/(file name.ext) - to create a file in a directory within the current directory
