# Expressions and Operators

## Expressions
- Assignment operators - assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. *ex. x=y*
- Comparison operators - compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether or not it's true. 
- Arithmetic operators - takes a numerical value as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

## Loops

### `for` Loops
A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to `false`. The JavaScript `for` loop is similar to the Java and C `for` loop. This will ALWAYS be based on incremental values.

A `for` statement looks as follows:

```
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
```

When a `for` loop executes, the following occurs:
1. The initializing expression `initialExpression`, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
2. The `conditionExpression` expression is evaluated. If the value of `conditionExpression` is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of `condition` is false, the `for` loop terminates. (If the `condition` expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
3. The `statement` executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement (`{ ... }`) to group those statements.
4. If present, the update expression `incrementExpression` is executed.
5. Control returns to Step 2.
