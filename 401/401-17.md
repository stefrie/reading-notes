# Code 401 | Reading 17 - AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **Describe "The Cloud"**\
    The "cloud" is meant to describe the practice of storing data, servers, databases, etc. on the internet as opposed to on a local server, which has been the practice in the past.

-   **What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**\
    A container is self-contained software that can run in many different types of computing environments.

-   **What is auto-scaling?**\
    Auto-scaling is the process of automatically adjusting resources sent to a container based on what is required by the container at any en time.

-   **What is bandwidth?**\
    Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that a particular service can provide, or to what services a particular piece of software may require to run properly

-   **How do cloud providers compute service costs?**\
    Because of auto-scaling, providers are able to bill based upon usage

| Cloud Service            | A service provided to clients to have their data, servers, etc. hosted on the internet instead of having to keep servers locally/onsite to perform the same function                                                                                                      |
| Cloud Architecture       | The combined structure of components that make up a cloud and shared across a network                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| AWS                      | Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing service                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| EC2/Beanstalk vs. Heroku | Very similar services , but "Herokuâ€™s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features, e.g., auto-scaling, where-as AWS pricing is fairly linear." (from [Codeburst.io](https://codeburst.io/heroku-v-s-aws-elastic-beanstalk-1cc6f12ca3c7)) |
