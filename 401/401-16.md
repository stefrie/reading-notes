# Code 401 | Reading 16 - AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle.**
    -   The Web Request Response Cycle (WRRC) is a paradigm that allows machines to "talk" to one another to request and retrieve data from other machines
-   **Explain what a "server" is, as it relates to the WRRC.**
-   A server is a machine that manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network
-   **What does it mean to "deploy" an application?**
    -   Deploying an application is when you send data that is stored locally or in a repo to a remote centralized resource (server)
