# Code 401 | Reading 2 - Express

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **Whatâ€™s the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?** PUT method gives a modified version of the requested resource that replaces the original version, whereas PATCH gives instructions on how to modify the resource.
-   **Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to "mock" an API for development like `json-server`.**

1. [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/)
2. [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/)
3. [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com)

-   **Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js.**
    -   Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
-   **Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST**
    -
-   Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
    -   Web Server - software/hardware that uses HTTP to send requests and respond to same over the internet
    -   Express - Express is a web app framework
    -   Routing - Routing is what allows you to send a variety of different types of requests to various servers/APIs
    -   WRRC (Web Request Response Cycle) - the paradigm that allows machines to "talk" to one another to request and retrieve data from other machines
