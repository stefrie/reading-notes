# Code 401 | Reading 36 - Application State with Redux

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”**
    Local storage occurs on the client side and can store up to 5mb of data, whereas cookies are server-side and can only store up to 4kb of data
-   **Explain 3rd party cookies.**
    Third-party cookies are created by domains other than the one you're visiting, primarily used for advertising purposes
-   **How do pixel tags work?**
    Pixel tags attach to a browser and collect information about a user and their actions on the internet
