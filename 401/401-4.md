# Code 401 | Reading 4 - Data Modeling

-   Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development.
    -   offers the ability to take small steps, focus on one task at a time, ensuring its success prior to moving on
    -   can conceivably create more flexible modular code
-   What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
    -   it might be difficult to see the forest for the trees. For example you might have all of the individual tests running as they should be, but when you put them all together, it may mean that the entire program isn't working.
-   In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?
-   Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
-   Why REST?

**Document the following Vocabulary Terms:**

-   functional programming - programming that utilizes functions as a means to create programs
-   object-oriented programming (OOP) - programming that utilizes classes and objects as a means to create programs
-   class
    -   `super` - keyword used to access and call functions on an object's parent
    -   `this`
-   Test Driven Development (TDD) - software requirements are tested repeatedly while the software is being written (as opposed to tests being run after the code is finished)
-   Jest - a JavaScript testing framework
-   Continuous Integration (CI) - the concept of many programmers merging their code into a main branch repeatedly throughout the day
-   REST
-   Data Model

## Preview

-   Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
-   Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
-   What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
