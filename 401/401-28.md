# Code 401 | Reading 28 - Component Lifecycle / `useEffect()` Hook

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?**
-   **If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?**
    -   **Outside the `<BrowserRouter/>`**
    -   **Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`**
    -   **Inside a `<Route />`**
-   **What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested?**
-   **What does `props.children` contain?**
-   **How do `useState()` and `this.setState()` differ?**
