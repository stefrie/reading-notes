# Code 401 | Reading 7 - Bearer Authorization

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Write the following steps in the correct order:
   **OAuth handshake process**

-   [a] Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
-   [b] Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
-   [c] Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
-   [d] Receive authorization code
-   [e] Make a request to the access token endpoint
-   [f] Receive access token
-   [g] Make a request to a third-party API endpoint

2. What can you do with an authorization code?\
   With an authorization code, you can create and get an access token from the third party

3. What can you do with an access token?\
   With an access token, you can access data via API on behalf of a user

4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client ID**               | Public identifier for application                                                                                             |
| **Client Secret**           | A value known only to the app and authorization server that is used to validate the ID                                        |
| **Authentication Endpoint** | Endpoint used to figure out who someone is                                                                                    |
| **Access Token Endpoint**   | An endpoint that returns an access token, usually includes the Authorization Code                                             |
| **API Endpoint**            | Enables you to manage all aspects of user identity; endpoints are where users can log in, sign up, log out, access APIs, etc. |
| **Authorization Code**      | Temporary code that the client exchanges for an access token                                                                  |
| **Access Token**            | Allows an application to access an API                                                                                        |
