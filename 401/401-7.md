# Code 401 | Reading 7 - Bearer Authorization

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Write the following steps in the correct order:

-   [a] Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
-   [b] Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
-   [c] Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
-   [d] Receive authorization code
-   [e] Make a request to the access token endpoint
-   [f] Receive access token
-   [g] Make a request to a third-party API endpoint

2. What can you do with an authorization code?\
   With an authorization code, you can create and get an access token from the third party

3. What can you do with an access token?\
   With an access token, you can access data via API on behalf of a user

4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

| **Client Secret**         | Client secret is a 'secret' known only to the app and authorization server                                                    |
| **Access Token Endpoint** | Used by the app to get an access token                                                                                        |

| **Authorization Code**    | Temporary code that the client exchanges for an access token                                                                  |
