# Code 401 | Reading 27 - `useState()` Hook

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?**
    React/JSX differs from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS in that React is a library that we can pull from to mimic the functionality of HTML and CSS. The code even _looks_ like HTML and CSS, however it is not actually HTML and CSS.

-   **What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?**
    Functional components require the use of React hooks and are more efficient in terms of both time and space as compared to class components
