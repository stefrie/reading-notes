# Code 401 | Reading 8 - Access Control (ACL)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
    -   Basic Authorization requires a username and password, whereas Bearer Authorization utilizes a token
-   What does the JSON Web Token package do?\
    -   JSON web token packages add functionality the JSON package that allows apps to authenticate user information in order to send data requests to the client
-   What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?\
    -   Secrets should be long in order to decrease the 'hackability' of the users login information
