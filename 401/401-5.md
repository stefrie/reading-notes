# Code 401 | Reading 5 - Linked Lists

## Big O Notation

At its most basic level, "Big O" is used to describe the efficiency of a program, from both a runtime perspective, but also in regards to how much bandwidth or memory the program requires.

More specifically, we use Big O to describe the 'worst-case scenario' so we can mitigate for potential issues in getting the program to run. We do this by analyzing the following four areas:

-   **Input size** - we use `n` to refer to the size value; this refers to both the number of parameters, but the size of the parameter _values_ as well.
-   **Units of measurement** - we consider three different measurements of time:
    -   **Running time:**
        -   time in milliseconds
        -   number of operations executed - number of lines of code executed from start to finish
        -   number of "basic operations" executed - the operation that contributes most to the total running time (usually within the inner-most loop)
    -   **Memory space** (four sources of memory usage):
        -   amount of space needed to hold the _code_
        -   amount of space needed to hold the _input data_
        -   amount of space needed to hold the _output data_
        -   amount of space needed to hold the _working space during the calculation_
-   **Orders of growth** - as the value of the input `n` grows, the **order of growth** represents an increase in running time or memory space.
-   **Best case, worst case, average case**

## Linked Lists

**What is a Linked List?**

-   They are recursive
-   Consists of nodes, each node is a data reference3, as well as a reference to another Node
-   Points to specific things in an orderly way
-   A way to “link” data together dynamically ()
-   Other languages still have arrays, but they aren’t dynamic
-   As soon as you create an array, you have to specify a size and you can’t add anything else to it
-   A Linked List can grow when we need it to

**Linked List Terminology**

-   Node - what makes up a linked list; main job is to store data (a value and a next property)
-   Value - anything you want to store in a linked list (numbers, objects, arrays, null, undefined, etc.)
-   Next - a reference to another Node
-   Current - A Node that is being read during a “traversal”
-   Head - the first Node in a Linked List
-   Singly - All Nodes have only reference to another Node
-   Doubly - All nodes have two references to other Nodes
    -   Previous - A reference to another Node besides next
