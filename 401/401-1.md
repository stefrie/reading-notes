1. Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does  
   Array.map() is a function that cycles through all of the elements in an array, performs the action on each individual element, and returns a new array.
2. Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does
   Array.reduce() is a function that will reduce elements in an array after performing an action on each preceding element within the array.
3. Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result

-   With normal Promise .then() syntax

```
const superagent = require('superagent');
superagent.post('/api/pet').then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```

-   Again with async / await syntax

```
(async () => {
  try {
    const res = await superagent.post('/api/pet');
    console.log(res);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```

4. Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student
5. Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?
   Not necessarily; whether a function is async or not really depends more on async/await keywords
