# Code 401 | Reading 19 - AWS: Events

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server**\
    I don't know, but I'd love to know!

-   **List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each**\
    The database offerings are listed on the [AWS Database home page](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/?nc=sn&loc=1). There are a great variety of database types that AWS offers depending on your particular use case.

-   **Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**\
    FIFO doesn't handle duplicates.

-   **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**\
    We can set up the client to ensure a response is sent when the message has been received.

| Dynamo vs Mongo       | DynamoDB is fully managed by AWS and is better for smaller projects, while MongoDB may be more cost-effective for larger-scale DBs                                               |
| Dynamoose vs Mongoose | Dynamoose is intended to be used with dynamodb, and Mongoose is intended to be used with MongoDB                                                                                 |
