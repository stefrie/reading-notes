# Code 401 | Reading 3 - Express REST API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware.
-   True or false: The route handler is middleware?
-   In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
-   At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
-   What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

-   **Document the following Vocabulary Terms:**
    -   Middleware - a type of software that provides services to software applications
    -   Request Object - this object represents the HTTP request and is one-half the request/response cycle
    -   Response Object - this object represents the response sent back and is one-half the request/response cycle
    -   Application Middleware - middleware bound to the app object by using `app.use()` and `app.method()`
    -   Routing Middleware - bound to an instance of `express.Router()`
    -   Test Driven Development -
    -   Behavioral Testing -

## Preview

-   Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
-   Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
-   What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
