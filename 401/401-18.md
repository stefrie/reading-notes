## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **What are serverless functions?**
    -   Serverless functions are functions written for an express purpose
-   **If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?**
    -
-   **Describe how a CDN works**
    -   A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of serversthat are geographically-distributed in order to provide availability to end users, and to prevent bottlenecks in performance (such as when all servers are co-located)
