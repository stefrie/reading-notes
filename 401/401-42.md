## **Selections**

### **[The code I’m still ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)** - Bill Sourour | Nov 13, 2016

This article was certainly thought-provoking, and I've continued to think on it here and there since I've read it. Ethics has been top of mind for me in recent years; one of the most difficult lessons I've learned is that where the bar lies in what constitutes ethical behavior vs. unethical behavior can vary widely from person to person. When there's a discrepancy in where that bar lies between two individuals is when there can be some very real interpersonal conflict. Then, when Person A with a higher ethical standard calls out Person B whose ethical standards may not be so high, it can really come back and bite Person A on the ass in a very real and life-damaging kind of way. Don't ask me how I know this.

Regardless of my very negative experience, I will still continue to call out behaviors and actions I find unacceptable, whether that's how other human beings are being treated, or if it's being asked to carry out a directive with which I do not agree. What is most notable about this article is that the author didn't even seem to think about the impact his actions would have. It's difficult to put TOO much blame on him because he was young and because it was impossible for him to foresee his potential contribution to someone's death as the result of doing his job. All the same, it's a good reminder to be constantly curious, and to ask questions or raise flags if there are real concerns about the work being done. It is better to be a conscientious objector than potentially complicit.

### **[Big Data is our Civil Rights issue](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)** - Alistair | Jul 31, 2012

Yet another thought-provoking article. What's most intriguing about this article is that it was written and published in 2012, which was just when Big Data was coming into the foray as the newest technological development. While I'm not sure if the predictions that the author made have proven to be true, it's certainly allowed service providers (such as the credit card company in the article) be able to make decisions about large groups of people that fit certain criteria. That, in and of itself, is alarming. More alarming is the fact that it seems the general public is largely resigned to how they know their data is used. But how do we come back from here?
