# Code 401 | Reading 37 - Redux - Combined Reducers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?**
    Redux is a better option in situations where there are high frequency of updates.
-   **What is the purpose of a reducer?**
    A pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state.
-   **What does an action contain?**
-   **Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?**
