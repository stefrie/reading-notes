# Code 401 | Reading 11 - Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   Why is access control important?
    -   There are many times when you may only wish to allow access to certain content based on the end user's role. Security and confidentiality are just two reasons you might wish to do this.
-   Describe an application that would need access control.
    -   I've worked with [Workday](https://www.workday.com/) in the past (an enterprise HR system). There are many security roles built into the system which allow certain people access to specific content
-   What is a role used for?
    -   To define the capabilities associated with a specific user type
-   ## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

| Role Based Access Control | a way to restrict access to users based on their roles                                                  |
| Capabilities              | specific actions that an end-user can use based on the role assigned to them                            |
