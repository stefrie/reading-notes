# Code 401 | Reading 26 - Component Based UI

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-   **Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)**

1. Angular.js
1. Vue.js
1. Ember
1. Svelte
1. Sencha Ext JS

-   **Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?**\
    Frameworks and libraries are very similar in that they're both using someone else's 'prefab' code, but you'd use frameworks to build the structure, whereas libraries are what you'd use to augment the existing code.

| Rendering | Rendering is an automatic part of the React lifecycle that will reflect how state is instantiated on a page |
| Templates | React templates are higher-level templates much like frameworks but for an entire site                      |
| State     | State is an object used by React to reflect that component's situation                                      |
