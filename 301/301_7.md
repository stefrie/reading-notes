## Reading
- [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html)
    - If you took Code 201, skim this article again for a refresher. If you did not take Code 201, read this article and think about how it can influence the way you work with your partners during pair programming.

**1. Who is Roy Fielding?**\
Roy Fielding was a smart man who wrote the first web servers, sent documents across the internet, then wrote documentation on why the internet works the way it does.

**2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**\
They weren't designed to be used like that. We use redirects instead of directly accessing information, which slows down processing. 

**3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**\
The HTTP protocol is a way to describe the location of information on the internet. In the article, the analogy is "GPS coordinates for knowledge and information."

**4. What does a `GET` do?**\
`GET` is a universal verb that can be applied to any URL (or "noun" in this article). It's how data is requested from a server.

**5. What does a `POST` do?**\
`POST` sends changes from the client to the server, such as making a new entry.

**6. What does `PUT` do?**\
`PUT` is a way to revise or add to existing information.

**7. What does `PATCH` do?**\
`PATCH` is similar to `PUT` but is a partial update.

## API Keys
Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
