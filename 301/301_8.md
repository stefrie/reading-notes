**5. What should the URIs be based on?**\
A good URI is named based on nouns as opposed to verbs.

A good URI will have a consistent naming convention, use plural nouns for URIs that reference collections, and are organized into collections and items within a hierarchy.

**7. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?**\
"Chatty" APIs are not ideal; when an API is considered "chatty" is when it sends many requests to the web server, which can bog the server down.

`200 OK`

**9. What status code does an unsuccessful `GET` request return?**\
`404 (Not Found)`

**10. What status code does a successful `POST` request return?**\

**11. What status code does a successful `DELETE` request return?**\
`204 (No Content)`
