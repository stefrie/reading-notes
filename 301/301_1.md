### [Component Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)
**What is a component?**
A component is a "package" (of sorts) of code used in conjunction with other code or components. It's intended to be modular and reusable. 

**What are the charactistics of a component?**
- *reusability* − typically written so as to be reused in a variety of scenarios
- *replaceable* − should be able to be replaced with other similar components
- *not context-specific* − similar to 'reusability', designed to work in different environments and contexts
- *extensible* − component properties can be extended to other components to create new functionality
- *encapsulated* − it allows only the interfaces to be shown, effectively hiding internal processes or variables
- *independent* − shouldn't be dependent on other components

**What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**
- *ease of deployment/development* - independent characteristic of components makes replacing components and programming existing ones easier, as it won't have an impact to other components
- *reliability* - increases reliability since each component can be reused and reduces errors/bugs
- *system maintenance and evolution* - easy to change update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system

### [Props and How to Use it in React](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProps%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20special%20keyword,way%20from%20parent%20to%20child)
**What is props short for?**
"Props" is short for "properties."

**How are props used in React?**
Props are used to pass data from one component to another.

**What is the flow of props?**
Data with props pass *only* in one direction - from parent to child. It is also read-only which means child components can't pass data to parent components.
