## Reading
[Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

**1. What is functional programming?**\
Functional programming is a way of building structure and elements of a program that treats computation as the evaluation of functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

**2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**\
A pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments, and doesn't cause any observable side effects.

**3. What are the benefits of a pure function?**\
Pure functions are easily tested.

**4. What is immutability?**\
Immutability is code that's unable to be changed or doesn't change over time.

**5. What is Referential transparency?**\
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
