# Code 301 | Reading 3 - Passing Functions as Props
## Reading
[React Docs - lists and keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

1. What does `.map()` return?\
`.map()` allows us to take an array of numbers and double their values

2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?\
`numbers.map((number) => number * 2);`

3. Each list item needs a unique ____________.\
Key

4. What is the purpose of a key?\
They help React know what's been changed, added, or removed. Ideally they're added to elements *within* the array so that the elements have a stable identity.

[The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

1. What is the spread operator?\
The spread operator separates each part of an array into its own argument.

2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
- Copy an array
- Concatenate or combine arrays
- Use Math functions
- Use arrays as arguments

[The below three examples are ]
3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.\
In the below example, in addition to combining arrays, you can also add new items, as seen by `fruits[0]`
```
const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍
```

4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.\
See above.

5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.\
```
const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
```


### Videos
[How to Pass Functions Between Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU)

1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
2. In your own words, what does the `increment` function do?
3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
