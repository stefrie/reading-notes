## Reading
**Consider the history: [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)**\
- **What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**\
Around the time that women in CS started declining was the time that PCs started showing up in US homes in significant numbers.

- **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**\
Because males had exposure to the technology as well as some of the programmatical aspects of computers for a much larger part of their lives than females.

**Review the data: [Employee breakdown of key technology companies](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)**\
- **What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**\


**Ask the question: [Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)**\
- **When are diversity efforts most successful?**\
They're most successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders and leaders understand or attempt to learn why diversity matters.

- **Why do diverse companies perform better?**\
Diverse teams are more creative and innovative; they bring a multitude of perspectives and faster or better ways of addressing them.

- **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vice-versa.**\
A company that has a diversity of perspectives will necessarily be able to serve a more diverse user base. Lack of diversity can actually have life-or-death consequences.
