## Reading
[Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)

**1. What is a "call"?**\
A call is what is meant by invoking a function.

**2. How many "calls" can happen at once?**\
Only one call can happen at a time.

**3. What does LIFO mean?**\
LIFO means "Last In, First Out' - essentially, the last function pushed into the stack will be the first to pop out when the function returns.

**4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**\
```
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
```

**5. What causes a Stack Overflow?**\
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

**3. What is a "range error"?**\

**4. What is a "type error"?**\
An error given when you try to use a data type that is incompatible or an undefined property

**5. What is a breakpoint?**\
