# Code 301 | Reading 4 - React and Forms
## Reading
[React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

**1. What is a "Controlled Component"?**\
A controlled component is an input form element whose value is controlled by React by making the React state be the "single source of truth."

**2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?**\
Based on this reading, it sounds like we should update the state with their responses as they enter them. This is because we can write functions that will update as the user types. I could be wrong about that, though.

**3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**\
We would add a `name` attribute to the elements and let the handler function determine what needs to be done based on `event.target.name`.
 

[The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)\
**1. Why would we use a ternary operator?**\
It's a much more efficient way of writing an if/else statement.

**2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**\
`x===y ? true : false`
