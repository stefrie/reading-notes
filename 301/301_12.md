- **100’s** = informational status codes; usually the request has been received and the server is attempting to respond
- **200’s** = success codes; they tell the client that the request was accepted
- **300’s** = redireciton codes; they tell the client the resource isn't available at that location anymore
- **400’s** = client error codes; invalid requests a client sends to a server
- **500’s** = server error codes; indicate problems with overwhelmed or unreachable servers
