#### HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)

- **Inline elements** are elements that are embedded within the text or content itself; examples are `<em>` and `<b>` tags
- **Group text and elements inline or in a block** by using the `<div>` or `<span>` tags
- **iframes** add "windows" to your page where you can embed content from anywhere else on the web (including your own page)
- **meta** elements allow you to include information about the page that isn't visible to the user
