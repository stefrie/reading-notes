# JavaScript

## Expressions and Operators
There are a variety of **operators**:
- Assignment operators - assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. *ex. x=y*
- Comparison operators - compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether or not it's true. 
- Arithmetic operators - takes a numerical value as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

An **expression** is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

## Functions 
**Functions** are similar to a procedure or process. It includes:
- Name of the function
- List of parameters to the function, enclsed in parentheses and separated by commas
- JS statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets `{...}`

## Control Flow
The **control flow** is the order in which the commputer executes statements in a script. It will always run in order from first line to last line, unless there is a loop unless or until a condition is met, or a conditional that requires skipping part of the code.
