# Code 201 | Reading 13 - Local Storage

[“The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications”](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html)

Currently, cookies are used to store data locally, but it only works for small amounts of data. 
**Other downsides to local storage:**
1. slows down your web app by transmitting the same data repeatedly
2. sends unencrypted data over the internet (unless you have SSL server)
3. limited to 4KB data

Many attempted fixes at the problem emerged, but ultimately, HTML5 Storage (or "Local Storage" or "DOM Storage") came about as a way to store mini-databases locally within the web browser.

Using this allows you to store data from forms, etc. within the browser itself and negate the need for a remote server to create a database for data storage. 

**3 Potential Limitations**
1. "5 megabytes" - storage limitation consistent across browsers. 
2. "QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR" if you exceed your 5mb storage quota
3. "No" - answers the question "Can I ask the user for more space?"

Advanced, persistent, local storage: **the Indexed Database API** fka "WebSimpleDB" nka "IndexedDB"
