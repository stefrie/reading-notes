# Code 201 | Reading 3 - HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
***
## From the Duckett HTML book:
### Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
There are three different types of lists: ordered, unordered, and definition lists. 
Lists can also be nested

### Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
Box Dimensions: width and height
- Can be limited by using min-width and max-width, or min-height and max-height
- Overflow property can hide extra content that doesn't fit into the box. It can allow for keeping the boxes the same size while still retaining all of the content.

Beyond the Content
- **Border**: This is the outline around the box itself
- **Margin**: Margins are the amount of space around the border
- **Padding**: The amount of space between the border and any content within the box


## From the Duckett JS book:
### Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)


### Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)
