# Code 201 | Reading 12 - Docs for the HTML `<canvas>` Element & Chart.js

**Assorted bits of documentation:**
- Read [this article](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/) on the Chart.js API.
    This is a great article on how to use the chart.js plugin to create charts on your site. 

- [Chart.js docs](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/): Youâ€™ll be needing these!
    I wasn't able to read through all of this, but there's a lot of documentation on different data structures, colors, fonts, padding, configuration, etc. 

- Read the following MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) articles on the Canvas API.
    - [Basic usage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage) - description, difference from `<img>` tag
    - [Drawing shapes with canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes) - this site shows how to make a variety of shapes using canvas, from grids, rectangles, paths, lines, arcs, etc.
    - [Applying styles and colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Applying_styles_and_colors) - includes colors, but also transparency, fill, line width, etc.
    - [Drawing text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_text) - for how to manipulate text with different alignments, directions, or using outlines on the text
