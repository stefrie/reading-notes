# Code 201 | Reading 10 - Debugging
***
## From the Duckett JS book:
### JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging” pp. 449-486
Review **order of execution** to find the source of the error

#### Execution Context and Hoisting
Two phases of activity: Prepare and Execute
- **Prepare** is when the JS runs through the code once, and **executes** on the second review. This is how you can call on variables *before* they're declared.

Use the **console log** to determine where the bug is located within your code

#### Errors and Error Objects
**Error objects** are what show up in the console log when the page encounters an error. They consist of:
- Error type - see below
- Message - description
- fileNumber - name of the JS file
- lineNumber - the line on the JS file where the bug is located

*Example:* `Uncaught ReferenceError: putProductsInStorage is not defined at HTMLDivElement.handleClick         app.js:115`

There are seven different **error types** in JavaScript:
1. `Error` - generic
2. `SyntaxError` - incorrect symbols, text, characters are used, usually a typo
3. `ReferenceError` - code is being referenced that doesn't exist or isn't within scope
4. `TypeError` - data type error
5. `RangeError` - number not within the acceptable range
6. `URIError` - when `encodeURI()` or `decodeURI()` or others are used incorrectly
7. `EvalError` - the `eval()` function is being used incorrectly

Use **try**, **catch**, and **finally** statements
