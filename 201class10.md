***
## From the Duckett JS book:
### JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”
Review **order of execution** to find the source of the error


**Execution Context and Hoisting**
Two phases of activity: Prepare and Execute
**Prepare** is when the JS runs through the code once, and **executes** on the second review. This is how you can call on variables *before* they're declared.

**Errors**

**Error Objects**
- Error
