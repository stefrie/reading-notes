### From the Duckett HTML book:
#### Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)
**Control size of images in CSS**
- Use `width` and `height` properties. Commonly used image sizes:
    - Small portrait: 220 x 360
    - Small landscape: 330 x 210
    - Feature photo: 620 x 400

**Aligning images using CSS**
- CSS `float` property is being used more often
- Also `align-left` or `align-right`

**Background images**
- `background-image` allows for placing an image behind any HTML element (section, div, etc.)

**Repeating images**
- `background-repeat`
    - `repeat` - image is repeated horizontally and vertically
    - `repeat-x` - image is repeated horizontally only
    - `repeat-y` - image is repeated verically only
    - `no-repeat` - image is only shown once
- `background-attachment`
    - `fixed` to have the background image stay in place
    - `scroll` to have the background image scroll as the user scrolls

**Background position**
- use `background-position` to specify where the background position should be placed (i.e. left top, left center, left bottom, etc.)

**Image rollovers and sprites**
- Rollovers change to a second style when a user rolls over an element (link or button) and a third style when they click on it.
- Sprites - when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface

**Gradients**
- Gradients are added using `background-image` property. 
- Most gradients are linear (not much support for other types)

**Contrast**
- Overlaying text on background images, make sure to use low contrast for the text to be legible

#### Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)
**SEO, or Search Engine Optimization**
- the practice of trying to help your site appear at the top of search engine results with the goal of funneling more web traffic to your website.
- *On-page techniques* - using keywords that people will use in search engines to find your website. 
- *Off-page techniques* - getting other sites to link to your page

**On-page SEO**
Seven places where keywords can appear; consider these locations when implementing keywords to drive traffic to your site:
- page title
- URL or web address
- headings
- text
- link text
- image alt text
- page descriptions

**Google Analytics**
Use Google Analytics to add a tracking code to your site that will give you data from Google servers about the traffic on your site, such as:
- number of visits
- number of unique visits
- page views
- pages per visit
- average time on site
- date selector
- export (export data into Excel or another application)

It can also tell you what visitors are looking at:
- pages (which pages are visitors viewing most)
- landing pages (what page is bringing visitors to your site)
- top exit pages (shows which pages people most commonly leave from)
- bounce rate (who left on the same page they arrived)
