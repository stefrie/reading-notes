# Stef's Code Fellows Brain Dump

Hello! My name is Stefanie. I'm a former HR professional making the switch to coding like I should have done over 20 years ago. I live in Seattle with a precocious 6-year old part of the time and with many, many plants all of the time. Here's some places you can find me on Teh Interwebs:

- _[GitHub](https://github.com/stefrie)_
- _[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanie-riehle/)_
