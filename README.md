### Three Reminders in Keeping a Growth Mindset
When confronted with a challenge that seems overwhelming: 
- Stop, take a deep breath (or three)
- Replace negative self-talk with reminders of what is motivating me to succeed
- Think of one way I can reframe and view the problem from a different perspective
