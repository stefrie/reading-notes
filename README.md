# Stef's Code Fellows Brain Dump

Hello! My name is Stefanie. I'm a former HR professional making the switch to coding like I should have done over 20 years ago. I live in Seattle with a precocious 5-year old and many, many plants. Here's some places you can find me on the interwebs:
- *[GitHub](https://github.com/stefrie)*
- *[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanieriehle/)*
- *[Seattle SHRM Board of Directors](https://shrm-seattle.site-ym.com/page/Leadership68)*

## Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset is the idea that one can continuously develop their abilities through persevering beyond failures and setbacks. 

### Three Reminders in Keeping a Growth Mindset
When confronted with a challenge that seems overwhelming: 
- Stop, take a deep breath (or three)
- Replace negative self-talk with reminders of what is motivating me to succeed
- Think of one way I can reframe and view the problem from a different perspective
