# Stef's Code Fellows Brain Dump

Hello! My name is Stefanie. I'm a former HR professional making the switch to coding like I should have done over 20 years ago. I live in Seattle part-time with a precocious 5-year old and full-time with many, many plants. Here's some places you can find me on Teh Interwebs:
- *[GitHub](https://github.com/stefrie)*

## Growth Mindset
The idea that one can continuously develop their abilities through persevering beyond failures and setbacks.

### Three Reminders in Keeping a Growth Mindset
When confronted with a challenge that seems overwhelming: 
- Stop, take a deep breath (or three)
- Replace negative self-talk with reminders of what is motivating me to succeed
- Think of one way I can reframe and view the problem from a different perspective
