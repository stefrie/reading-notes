Hello! My name is Stefanie. I'm a former HR professional making the switch to coding like I should have done over 20 years ago. I live in Seattle with a precocious 5-year old part of the time and with many, many plants all of the time. Here's some places you can find me on Teh Interwebs:
- *[GitHub](https://github.com/stefrie)*
- *[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanie-riehle/)*
- *[Seattle SHRM Board of Directors](https://shrm-seattle.site-ym.com/page/Leadership68)*
